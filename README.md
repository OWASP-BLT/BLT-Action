# BLT-Action README

## Introduction

**BLT-Action** is an innovative GitHub Action designed to streamline the issue management process in GitHub repositories. It provides a simple yet powerful mechanism to automatically assign users to issues, ensuring an organized and efficient workflow.

## Features

- **Automatic Assignment**: Users can self-assign to issues by commenting `/assign`.
- **Assignment Validation**: The action prevents multiple assignments by checking if a user is already assigned to an issue.
- **One Issue at a Time**: Limits users to be assigned to only one issue simultaneously.
- **Time-Based Unassignment**: Automatically unassigns users from issues if they are not resolved within 5 days, keeping the issue flow active.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- A GitHub repository where you have administrative privileges.

### Installation

1. **Add the Action to Your Repository**:
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository.
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory if it doesn't exist.
   - Create a new YAML file inside the workflows directory (e.g., `blt-action.yml`).
   - Add the following content to the YAML file:

    ```yml
    name: Auto Assign Issues
    
    on:
      issue_comment:
        types: [created]
      schedule:
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'
      workflow_dispatch:
    
    jobs:
      auto-assign:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Assign Issues
            uses: OWASP/BLT-Action@main
            with:
                repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    
    ```


### Usage

- To assign yourself to an issue, comment `/assign` on the issue.
- To unassign yourself to an issue, comment `/unassign` on the issue.
- The action will automatically check for your current assignments and assign you to the issue if you are eligible.
